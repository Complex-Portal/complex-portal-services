# Uniplex Import

## Introduction

The Uniplex Import is a Java service used to process files with HuMAP clusters, and import them into the Complex Portal database.

Currently, this service only support import of human complexes.

## How to run

Run the script [importUniplexClusters.sh](importUniplexClusters.sh) to process and import HuMAP clusters into Complex Portal.

By default, this script won't actually make any modifications in the database, it will just generate reports with the complexes that would be created and updated based on the input data.

To actually import data into the database, change property 'dry.run.mode' in the file [uniplex-import.properties](src/main/resources/META-INF/uniplex-import.properties) to false.

### Input arguments

The script takes the following 6 input arguments:
1. Maven profile
2. IntAct editor username
3. HuMAP input file
4. Directory to write report and output files
5. Separator used in the input file
6. Boolean to indicate if the input file has a header

### Input file format

The input file is expected to be a tabular file, with a HuMAP cluster in each row and 3 columns:
- HuMAP cluster id
- HuMAP cluster confidence
- List of UniProt ids for the proteins in the cluster (space separated)

```
clustID,cluster_confidence,uniprotACCs
<cluster_id_1>,<confidence_1>,<protein_1_1> <protein_1_2>
<cluster_id_2>,<confidence_2>,<protein_2_1> <protein_2_2> <protein_2_3>
...
```
